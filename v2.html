        <p>Last edited: 03/15/2022, version history on <a href="https://github.com/augmero/augmero.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>
        <p>This is an evolution of v1, the main difference is I'm using surface deform rather than mesh deform modifier in blender.</p>
        <p>I also made an attempt at cleaning up and simplifying some parts that got copied over</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
        <p>This is an experimental workflow. I am not an expert and I don't necessarily recommend anybody actually do this.</p>
        <p>If you are new to Blender or 3D this post is probably not for you, but bookmark it for later if you're interested</p>
        <p>However, if you are looking beyond Blender native physics I hope some of these notes will be useful! </p>
        <p>If you found this page and don't know who augmero is, fair warning some links are going to be NSFW. While this workflow can be useful for more general applications, I am using it for NSFW content</p>
        <p>Lastly, if you have ideas / improvements let me know! I'll keep this page updated</p>

                Ziva Dynamics is a plugin for Maya that specializes in character physics simulation and deformations.

        <h2>Why not just use Maya?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Many models and shared resources online have armatures and python scripts for Blender with no Maya version, it's not easy to port things to Maya
            </li>
            <li>
                Most of my experience and workflows (modeling, sculpting, rendering, materials, etc) is in Blender/Cycles, re-learning all of that stuff for Maya is a lot

        <h2>V2 vs V1</h2>

        <p>Like I mentioned at the top of the page, this is an evolution of v1, the main difference is I'm using surface deform rather than mesh deform modifier in blender.</p>
        <p>This is different enough I decided to make this into a separate page, v1 is still valid but in my opinion v2 is overall better</p>
        <p>I also made an attempt at cleaning up and simplifying some parts that got copied over</p>
        <p>Rather than using mesh deform and a cage like the v1 workflow, this one uses the original mesh and topology (for the most part) with the surface deform modifier.</p>
        <p>Pros</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Much more accurate deformations (no cage, follows the same topology)</li>
            <ul><li>For things involving fine details like hand collisions I certainly recommend this over v1</li></ul>
            <li>No need to remesh things to make a cage for the main Ziva tissue</li>
            <ul><li>I still remesh at times to make things like subtissues</li></ul>
        </ol>
        <p>Cons</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Shape keys don't do anything after surface deform is bound, resulting in fewer adjustments available after simulation</li>
            <li>It can be quite difficult in some cases to bind the surface deform modifier</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Note: Adding subdivision or triangulate to the target can help</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
            If you are new to Ziva/Maya, please watch the elephant tutorial, it goes over most of the basics:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA6C9xzf4f8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA6C9xzf4f8</a>
        </p>

        <p>These are the general steps for my workflow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make an animation with any model in Blender</li>
            <li>Make the tissue and bone meshes, export to Maya</li>
            <li>Set up and run Ziva physics sim in Maya</li>
            <li>Export Ziva physics sim, import to blender</li>
            <li>Surface deform original model</li>
        </ol>
        <a class="augmero-anchor" id="augmero-janchor-step1"></a>
        <p>
            <hr>
        </p><br>

        <h2>Step 1 - General set-up</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up character model with the most general desired shape (likely default pose, shape keys set up for body proportions</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You will be able to make adjustments (and animate adjustments) in Ziva as well but a good base gets better results</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Any simple animation is fine starting out, even an existing animation you want to add physics to</li>
            <li>Pick a frame where the physics simulation will start (I use frame 3) and make sure that your armature stays consistent at that frame.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I recommend keyframing rest pose at the first sim frame for the most consistency and ease of use.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Make vertex group for separating armature vs physics deformation</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Exclude more complex parts of the geometry in the physics</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generally, this includes the head, hands, feet, gens.</li>
                    <li>I include hands as a bone, not part of the tissue cage</li>
                </ul>
                <li>We will use this vertex group later for the first two modifiers on the render mesh like this:</li>

        <h2>Step 2 - Building the exports for Maya, and then exporting them</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to prepare your tissues and bones for Ziva, if you've got a better way let me know!</p>
        <p>Ziva is picky about what it lets you use as a tissue or bone. If you run into issues here's some documentation on what Ziva is looking for <a href="https://docs.Zivadynamics.com/vfx/mel_commands/zMeshCheck.html" target="_blank">zMeshCheck</a>
        </p>
        <h3>zBone example: hands</h3>
        <p>For some context, a zBone in Ziva is part of the simulation that is rigid and can collide with things</p>
        <p>Hands aren't incredibly squishy so to save on physics simulation calculations I just make them a bone.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Duplicate the model's mesh and remove all irrelevant vertices</li>
            <li>Fill the holes with grid fill</li>
            <li>That's it!</li>
            <ul><li>Note: If Ziva complains about the mesh when you import it later, check for weird toplogy. Things like fingernails might be messing with it. It's also worth smoothing out the harsh edges near any grid-filled holes</li></ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>zTissue example: body physics cage</h3>
        <p>zTissue in Ziva is where squishy happens and there's a lot of settings to play with</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Duplicate the model's mesh and remove all irrelevant vertices</li>
            <li>Test if the tissue is good by adding a surface deform modifier to the original model, adding the new one as the target of the modifier, and binding. Then test it by adding modifiers to the cage to make sure all the vertices are affected</li>
            <ul><li>Note: if surface deform won't bind, adding subdivision or triangulate (or both) modifiers to the target may help</li></ul>
            <li>Copy the vertex groups from your original mesh onto your new one using the data
                transfer modifier </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Click on 'Generate Data Layers' first and then apply the modifier</li>
                <li>Make sure the two meshes are overlapping, maybe put your armature in rest pose for this section</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Clean up deformation artifacts with corrective smooth modifier</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Exporting to Maya</h3>
        <p>It's export time</p>
        <p>There are multiple exports we have to do, </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Static mesh export (the cage for use as zTissue)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Export as FBX, here are the settings I use: </li>
                <li><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ACyb85c.png" alt="Maya mesh export screenshot"></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Animated export (zBones to attach to, zRestShapes, etc) </li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is an alembic export, for performance reasons I recommend excluding from view layer collections of anything that's not being exported</li>
                <ul><li>This means the checkbox on the collection. Export will be slower if anything else is being calculated by the view layer</li></ul>
                <li>For batch exporting alembics, I made a <a href="https://github.com/augmero/blender-alembic-bulk-exporter" target="_blank">python script</a>, to use it read the documentation in the script. This is much more quick and efficient than doing it through the blender UI</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h2>Step 3 - Set up the Ziva sim in Maya and run it</h2>
        <p>
            The elephant tutorial can probably teach the basics of Ziva better than me, here's a link again
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA6C9xzf4f8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA6C9xzf4f8</a>
        </p>
        <p>The elephant tutorial is quite similar to what I do, but my alembics are coming from Blender instead</p>
        <p>However, there are some specific notes I'd like to share </p>
        <h3>General Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set your Maya framerate to the same framerate you use in Blender</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Maya defaults to 24fps</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Import Blender alembic files into Maya</li>
            <li>Import Blender FBX files into Maya</li>
            <li>Duplicate (ctrl d) the static FBX for the body, it's going to do two different things</li>
            <li>One version of the static FBX is now going to become part of the physics sim, make it a zTissue</li>
            <li>The other version of this FBX is now going to become an animated zBone (disable collisons) for attaching the zTissue to</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make a blend shape on the static fbx pointing to the animated alembic (set envelope to 1)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Make attachments from the zTissue to the zBone </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure to set high strength attachments on parts where the cage is next to vertices that won't be part of the mesh deform, like by the head, wrists, feet, gens. Otherwise the physics sim will travel away from the armature and that's no good</li>
                <li>Remember to use vertex select before attaching and then weight paint the attachment to prevent it from affecting parts that don't need to be attached </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>I have left these steps fairly generic / sparse because the elephant youtube tutorial does such a good job of describing many things in Ziva, and there's a lot of artistic freedom here. This is a really fun part of the flow. There are some more specific Ziva notes I added after Step 5, I'll link them here. They are also in the floating menu</p>

        <h3>IMPORTANT NOTE READ THIS: REVISIONS</h3>
        Revisions are super important for any workflow, here's how to efficiently re-export/re-import your Blender alembics without having to re-do any of the later steps.
        <ol>
            <li>Save the Maya scene and then export your Blender alembics, overwriting the existing files.</li>
            <li>Use file->open recent and open the same file you currently have open. In reloading the file Maya will get the new animations you exported and you can run your physics simulation again! </li>
            <ul>
                <li>(Maya might crash if you try to keep going without re-opening the scene)</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h2>Step 4 - Export Ziva physics sim, import to Blender</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In Maya, select the mesh you want to export and click Cache -> Alembic Cache -> Export Selection to Alembic (this will play the animation as it's exporting)</li>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="https://i.imgur.com/elo06H2.png" alt="maya alembic export screenshot"></li>
            </ul>
            <li>In Blender import the file you just exported from Maya </li>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0QR3tRU.png" alt="blender alembic import screenshot"></li>

        <h2>Step 5 - Surface deform the original model in Blender</h2>
        <p>Simple example of the modifiers at the top of my stack for my render mesh:</p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wNboWne.png" alt="surface deform examples screenshot">
        <p>That's it! If everything went perfectly the deformations simulated in ziva will now show up on the render mesh</p>

        </p><br>

        <h2>Clothing</h2>
        <p>Some notes on clothes</p>
        <p>For interactive clothing, I add another zTissue but for the clothes in the physics sim</p>
        <p>This can have a good result on its own, but to take it a step further software like Marvelous Design can be used as another step afterwards</p>

        <a class="augmero-anchor" id="augmero-janchor-expansion"></a>
        <p>
            <hr>
        </p><br>
        <h2>Expansion</h2>
        <p>Expansion / inflation, there's a lot of possibilities and potential here</p>
        <p>Two main ways I've found to change the proportions on your character with Ziva</p>
        <ol>
            <li>zMaterials with rest scale</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pros: Fairly easy to set up</li>
                <li>Cons: For animating, you change the 'Rest Scale Envelope' on the Tissue, but this applies to all materials on that Tissue. So if you wanted to increase bust first and then back afterwards on the same Tissue this method won't work </li>

                <li>Export one more version of the cage from blender with shape keys over time as alembic! Thanks for the tip <a href="https://twitter.com/vanasmuttin" target="_blank">@vanasmuttin</a></li>
                <ul><li>I've run into some jankiness with this approach just be warned</li></ul>
                <li>Pros: Individual animation over time with envelopes</li>
                <li>Cons:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>An additional mesh needs to be exported</li>
                    <li>In some cases to lower artifacting rest shape influence needs to be turned down, however this makes the simulation less accurate the desired shape</li>
                </ul>
